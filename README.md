Description of study: We measured thermal performance curves (TPCs) in closely related tropical and temperate mayflies and stoneflies. We tested the hypothesis that differing thermal regimes of the two latitudes should favor the evolution of divergent TPCs. In particular, temperate species should have high performance over a broad range of temperatures, whereas their tropical relatives should have high performance across a narrow range of temperatures. Overall, we did not find support for this hypothesis.
Here, we provide our R code and data files for researchers interested in his study.
